This project is part of a fullstack simplified email application that works with protected routes, token jwt, login and register, styles with tailwindcss and interceptors. In login page the inputs has a initial value to work with backend data. So if you dont want to register a new user, you can use this credentials to use the application.

Here is the link of running application. If the backend part is offline send me an email because the host is free and it crashes sometimes
```bash
  https://springmail.netlify.app
```

First, to run this application locally, you need to clone the backend part in the following link. In readme file has all instructions to run the backend with success
```bash
  https://github.com/gabrielferreira02/springmail-backend/
```

Now that you have the backend ruuning, you can clone the project and go to the generated folder
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/gabrielferreira02/springmail-frontend.git
  cd springmail-frontend
```

Install project dependencies
```bash
  npm install
```

If when installing dependencies occur an error with angular and tailwind versions, use this command
```bash
  npm install --force
```

Then, start the angular application and see it running in your browser
```bash
  ng serve
```
